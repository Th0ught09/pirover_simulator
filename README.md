# PiRover Simulator

Pirover Simulator is a python based Simulator for the 4tronix Inition and Pi2Go Robots. These robots were intially used 
as an engaging way to teach python to children, by allowing them to write programs to make the robot move. Since not all 
schools have robots at hand and purchasing these would be expensive, this simulator was created.
